I am a Software Engineer working at the [Centre for Secure Information Technologies](https://www.qub.ac.uk/ecit/CSIT/). Working in Cyber Security I get exposure to alot of different tools and technologies so this wiki is where I'll keep various documents and tutorials for personal reference. 

I run the [Ethical Hacking & InfoSec group](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/team47/about/) at CSIT where likeminded individuals who are interested in breaking into systems, meetup and play on various cyber security platforms.
